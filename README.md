# My-Website-Portfolio

<p>This is my repository for my current web portfolio. I created my <a href="https://github.com/Anthony15651/Website-Portfolio" target="_blank">first website</a> right after learning the basics of HTML and CSS, so there was definitely a lot of room for improvement. I strive to create clean, functional code, and I wanted my website to represent that. When redesigning my website, I had three main things in mind: responsiveness, layout, and performance.</p>

<h1>Responsiveness</h1>
<p>One thing I disliked most about my previous website was that it only looked good on my specific screen size. When I had originally created the site, I didn't know anything about responsive design. This resulted in my site looking like a jumbled mess anytime the window dimensions were changed (especially on mobile screens). In order to overcome this, I took freeCodeCamp's responsive web design course and I used that knowledge to create dynamic content that will look good on any screen!</p>

<h1>Layout</h1>
<p>Another thing I disliked about my previous website was that it did not look visually appealing. As I previously mentioned, my original website was created right after learning the basics of HTML and CSS, and it almost feels like collection of what I had learned rather than a cohesive site. Various elements and properties were used just for the sake of being used. This time around I decided to select a color pallet and I sketched out visual rough-drafts of the site on some paper before I ever even started coding. By taking the time to plan out my design first, I feel that significantly less time was spent "fidgeting" with the layout to try and make it look the way I want it to.</p>

<h1>Performance</h1>
<p>The last thing I wanted to focus on when redesigning my website was the performace. With the superfluous elements mentioned above, my original website did not perform very well. It would take a long time for the page to open, and the animations on the screen were choppy. When rebuilding, I tried to take a "less is more" appoach. My goal was to keep the overall page weight down (to keep load times down), while also having enough design to keep the page from looking plain or boring.</p>
