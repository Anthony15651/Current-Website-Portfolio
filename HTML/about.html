          <!-- About Me: Where did I start -->
          My coding journey began when I was about 12, when my computer science
          teacher introduced me to
          <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank" class="clean-link"
            >Scratch</a
          >. I started developing simple games for my friends and I to play
          together in class. As I took in their feedback and refined my games, I
          discovered something about myself: I love to create things that other
          people enjoy using.

          <!-- About Me: How does my work fit into the world -->
          As I got older, my love for computers continued to expand and I became
          the unofficial "IT Support" for my family. Over time, I began to
          realize that one of the biggest struggles (at least for my family
          members), was simply navigating through a website. Layouts would be
          confusing, links would be scattered throughout, and sometimes things
          would not work as intended. With the rise of self-service technologies
          and more responsibility left to the individual, I strive to create
          software that is intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and functional.

          <!-- About Me: What is my passion -->
          A few years ago, I began working for Ferguson Enterprises as a member
          of their phone support team. I quickly worked my way up to the
          Showroom Consultant position, and began working out of the
          <a
            href="https://www.build.com/showroom/branch/portland-or-showroom-3016?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=shw_lis_listingtraffic&utm_content=listing"

            class="clean-link"
            >Portland showroom</a
          >. This was a great job and could have even been my career, but I
          wasn't fufilled with the work I was doing. It was then that I made one
          of the hardest decisions of my life, and I quit my job to follow my
          passion of becoming a software developer.

          <!-- About Me: How did I act on it -->
          After quitting my job, I enrolled in

            target="_blank"
            class="clean-link"
            >The Tech Academy's</a
          >
          Software Development bootcamp full-time. I completed the bootcamp and
          graduated with honors, but my learning did not stop there. Since then,
          I have continued to build on my skills using the wealth of knowledge
          available online. If you'd like to see some of the projects I've
          created, please check out
